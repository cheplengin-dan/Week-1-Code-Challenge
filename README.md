# Week-1-Code-Challenge
consists of:

* Student-Grade-Generator.
* Speed-Detector-.
* Net-Salary-Calculator.

## This are code challenges of the first week

This is a description of how the challenges work:

* The Student-Grade-Generator writes a program that prompts the user to input student marks.

* The Speed-Detector- writes a program that takes as input the speed of a car.

* The Net-Salary-Calculator writes a program that would calculate the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary.

## Challenge setup

On the first challenge i started by creating a random number 
betweem 0 and 100 then used an if else statement so as to print out the results later containing the values.The second challenge checks a speed then i used an if else statement to check if thats the value i'm looking for then rounded the number,then finaly checked if the points were greater than 12.
